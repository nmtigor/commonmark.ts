   * The observer will receive the actor’s snapshot value when it is emitted.
   * The observer can be:
   *
   * - A plain function that receives the latest snapshot, or
   * - An observer object whose `.next(snapshot)` method receives the latest
   *   snapshot
   *
   * @example
   *
   * ```ts
   * // Observer as a plain function
   * const subscription = actor.subscribe((snapshot) => {
   *   console.log(snapshot);
   * });

   * // Observer as an object
   * const subscription = actor.subscribe({
   *   next(snapshot) {
   *     console.log(snapshot);
   *   },
   *   error(err) {
   *     // ...

   *   complete() {
   *     // ...

   * });
   * ```
   *
   * The return value of `actor.subscribe(observer)` is a subscription object
   * that has an `.unsubscribe()` method. You can call

   *
   * @example
   *
   * ```ts
   * const subscription = actor.subscribe((snapshot) => {
   *   // ...
   * });
   *
   * // Unsubscribe the observer
   * subscription.unsubscribe();
   * ```
   *
   * When the actor is stopped, all of its observers will automatically be
   * unsubscribed.
